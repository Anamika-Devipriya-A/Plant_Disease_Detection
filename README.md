# Plant_Disease_Detection

**Plant Disease Detection in Apple Leaves using U-Net**

This repository contains the implementation of different architectures for the task of plant disease detection in apple leaves. The models is designed for multi-class classification, where it classifies each pixel in an input image into one of the 5 disease classes.

**Project Overview**

Plant disease detection is a critical task in agriculture as it helps in early disease identification and prevention. This project focuses on detecting diseases in apple leaves, a common issue faced by apple growers. The architecture is chosen for its ability to perform image segmentation, which is suitable for pixel-level classification tasks.
