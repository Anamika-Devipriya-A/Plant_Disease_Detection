Plant Disease Detection in Apple Leaves using U-Net
This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net architecture for the task of plant disease detection in apple leaves. The U-Net model is designed for multi-class classification, where it classifies each pixel in an input image into one of the 12 disease classes. This README provides an overview of the project, model architecture, usage instructions, and other relevant information.

Project Overview
Plant disease detection is a critical task in agriculture as it helps in early disease identification and prevention. This project focuses on detecting diseases in apple leaves, a common issue faced by apple growers. The U-Net architecture is chosen for its ability to perform image segmentation, which is suitable for pixel-level classification tasks.

Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture used in this project consists of the following key components:

Encoder
The encoder is responsible for down-sampling the input image.
It consists of several convolutional layers and max-pooling layers.
The number of filters in each layer increases to capture hierarchical features.
The spatial dimensions are reduced as we progress through the encoder.
Bridge
The bridge section is represented by a convolutional layer (b1).
It is typically used to connect the encoder and decoder sections.
Decoder
The decoder is responsible for up-sampling the features and recovering spatial information.
It consists of several decoder blocks, each containing a transposed convolution layer, concatenation with skip connections, and additional convolutional layers.
The spatial dimensions are increased as we progress through the decoder.
Output Layer
The final output layer produces segmentation maps with 12 channels (one for each class).
A softmax activation function is used to compute class probabilities for each pixel.
Flattening
After the decoder section, the output is flattened into a 1D tensor for further processing or classification.
Fully Connected Layers
Following the flattening step, three fully connected (dense) layers are added to capture high-level features and relationships within the flattened data.
The number of units in these dense layers can be adjusted as needed for the specific classification task.
Usage Instructions
Data Preparation: Prepare a dataset of labeled images of apple leaves, where each pixel is labeled with one of the 12 disease classes.

Model Training: Use the provided U-Net architecture to train the model on your dataset. You should specify the number of classes (12 in this case) in the output layer.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for image segmentation tasks.

Inference: Use the trained model for disease detection in apple leaves by inputting an image and generating a pixel-wise classification map.
